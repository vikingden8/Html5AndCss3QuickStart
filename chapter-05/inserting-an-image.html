<h1>Barcelona's Market</h1>

<img src="img/corner-market.jpg" alt="Oranges, bananas, apples, and other fruit abound at the Mercat de la Boquería."/>

<p>This first picture shows one of the fruit stands in the <span lang="es">Mercat de la Boquería</span>, the central
    market that is just off the Rambles. It's an incredible place, full of every kind of food you might happen to need.
    It took me a long time to get up the nerve to actually take a picture there. You might say I'm kind of a chicken,
    but since I lived there, it was just sort of strange. Do you take pictures of your supermarket?</p>
